The scripts inside the "Gamebridge" folder are notes from Alex Peake's Gamebridge University classes @ Noisebridge.


I am also creating an "Arduino Simulator" which aims to ease the barrier-of-entry to those just getting into microcontrollers by providing a 3D view of connections, animations of circuit and device-assembling, and simulator where you can virtually assemble and program an Arduino (for practice, experimentation without risk of burning it out).


(Will hope to port this to Android, IOS, and MacOsX, Linux, and Windows).






Many thanks to Alex Peake and cohorts at Noisebridge for their guidance and support!
