The scripts inside the "Gamebridge" folder are notes from Alex Peake's Gamebridge University classes @ Noisebridge.


I am also creating an Arduino simulator which will hopefully be awesome (and ported to Android, IOS, and MacOsX, Linux, and Windows).





Many thanks once again to to Alex Peake and cohorts at Noisebridge for their guidance and support!
